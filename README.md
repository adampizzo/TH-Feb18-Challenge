# TH-Feb18-Challenge
#For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based on their name. 
#Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. 
#Try to make sure that the program doesn't crash at any point!
#As an extra challenge, make the program continue to run until the user decides to quit.
